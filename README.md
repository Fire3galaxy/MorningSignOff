# MorningSignOff

This is the Android Studio project files for the Morning Signout application. The current structure of the application is that 
the front page will contain categories of articles and the latest publications. The categories page will contain article titles, 
images, and descriptions. Article pages will simply consist of title, image, article, and author.

## Current goals
* Create activity to be created on clicking category buttons.
* Integrate network calls to new activity to load actual article data.
* Integrate network calls to headline fragment in front page to show images/articles
